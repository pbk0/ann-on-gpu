ann-on-gpu
==========

This projects consists of cpu and gpu implementation of neural network designed to work as function approximator

The code in this project can serve as starting point for java programmers to port their parallel application on gpu using jcuda. User interface is designed in JavaFX. If you do not know JavaFX then also it is fine you can easily separate the java code and modify it for your usage. The key take away is jcuda implementation.

In this code an ANN is designed to serve as function approximator. The back-propagation training algorithm is also implemented. This can help java programmers in machine learning and other parallel computing domains to start off quickly with jcuda.
